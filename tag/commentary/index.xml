&lt;p>summary: With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, the authors summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware as well as personal protective equipment currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Teaching well is a craft like any other, and success often comes from an accumulation of small improvements rather than from any single large change. This paper describes 10 practices you can use when teaching programming (and other subjects). All are easy to adopt and have proven their value in institutional classrooms, intensive workshops, and other settings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Methods for measuring the properties of individual cells within their native 3D environment will enable a deeper understanding of embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis. However, current methods for segmenting nuclei in 3D tissues are not designed for situations in which nuclei are densely packed, nonspherical, or heterogeneous in shape, size, or texture, all of which are true of many embryonic and adult tissue types as well as in many cases for cells differentiating in culture. The authors provide a 3D editor and inspector for the manual curation of the segmentation results as well as a program to assess the accuracy of the segmentation. Blin et al. have also generated a live reporter of the NE that can be used to track live cells in 3 dimensions over time. The authors use this to monitor the history of cell interactions and occurrences of neighbour exchange within cultures of pluripotent cells during differentiation. The authors provide these tools in an open-access user-friendly format.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Open source projects are nothing but a collaborative effort of community members. The constant involvement of maintainers, contributors, and users make open source software sustainable and keeps the community as a whole going. Attracting new members, retaining them, and helping them be productive is not always as easy task. “Ten simple rules for helping newcomers become contributors to open projects”, as stated in the title, discusses ten simple rules projects should follow to help new contributors into their communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to measure animal activity without disturbing a hibernating animal your options were previously limited and expensive but the growing utility and shrinking price of sensors, cameras and single-board computers has enabled this device for monitoring mice nesting boxes using a Raspberry Pi and an infrared camera for under $400. The authors demonstrate the use of contact-free measurement of respiration rate, movement and surface body temperature with data logging and processing (so long as the mouse doesn&amp;rsquo;t block the camera with bedding!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Technological breakthroughs in the past two decades have ushered in a new era of biomedical research, turning it into an information-rich and technology-driven science. This scientific revolution, though evident to the research community, remains opaque to nonacademic audiences. Such knowledge gaps are likely to persist without revised strategies for science education and public outreach. To address this challenge, the authors developed a unique outreach program to actively engage over 100 high-school students in the investigation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The program uses robotic automation and interactive web-based tools to bridge geographical distances, scale up the number of participants, and reduce overall cost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Channel Editor Summary: In open source software, open code and free software is only the tip of the iceberg. Successful open source projects tend to have strong communities supporting both contributors as well as users - but this often comes with the hidden cost in volunteer (or staff) time and resources. The Scientific Community Image Forum helps to mitigate this concern by creating a single common forum for scientific imaging software that spans many domains and open source projects, and provides imaging software users with access to a broad range of experts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: A personalized approach based on a patient&amp;rsquo;s or pathogen’s unique genomic sequence is the foundation of precision medicine. Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet-lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Spikeling provides an in silico model of a spiking neuron that can be used to illustrate their biophysical behaviour through sound and light inputs and outputs as well as a custom oscilloscope interface. The authors evaluate the device in both Nigeria and the UK and provide exciting examples of potential uses from the classroom through to graduate study and public outreach. The ability to chain Spikelings together adds an extra dimension that opens up opportunities for experimentation with networks of neurons.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Whilst many open source projects enter the spotlight as trend-setting new software packages, it’s nice to appreciate some of the long-lived projects as well. HTCondor has been around since the 1980s, a decade before the term “open source” was even coined. HTCondor provides high throughput computing - granting compute power to those who may not have access to high performance computing, by utilising idle cycles on distributed volunteer computers. It can be used in multiple research domains to perform otherwise overly-intensive calculations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Many efforts are making science more open and accessible; they are mostly concentrated on issues that appear before and after experiments are performed: open access journals, open databases, and many other tools to increase reproducibility of science and access to information. However, these initiatives do not promote access to scientific equipment necessary for experiments. Mostly due to monetary constraints, equipment availability has always been uneven around the globe, affecting predominantly low-income countries and institutions. Here, a case is made for the use of free open source hardware in research and education, including countries and institutions where funds were never the biggest problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Difficulties reproducing scientific results are, in the vast majority of cases, not due to the authors having made mistakes or, even worse, forged data, writes Peter Wittek. Rather, the lack of detail about methods, data, and code in a paper is often the greatest impediment. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time we stopped hiding our code?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Lessons take significant effort to build and even more to maintain. Most academics do this work on their own, but leveraging a community approach can make educational resource development more sustainable, robust, and responsive. Treating lessons as a community resource to be updated, adapted, and improved incrementally can free up valuable time while increasing quality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: An open source toolkit for science is useful, but an open source toolkit that follows formal design principles might be even more so - improving interoperability, reproducibility and quality of designs. Oberloier and Pearce describe a five step procedure which encompasses six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. These include good quality documentation and validation data, parametric designs that allow generalisable solutions to problems encountered in the lab and the advice to &amp;ldquo;share aggressively&amp;rdquo;! This useful framework is illustrated by a neat project to design a slide dryer - a staple piece of kit for imaging labs to speed up processing of microscopy samples.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: This design is a rig for high-throughput behavioural experiments with genetically amenable model species such as fruit flies. At its core, it is a webcam (RPi camera) focussed at a set of interchangable behavioural arena arrays for parallel recording of multiple aninals at once. Laden with a light zapper for optogenetics, and a nice networking interface for controlling multiple units from a remote computer this looks like a great tool for high throughput ethomics!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: Metafluidics, an open-source, community-driven repository that hosts digital design files, assembly specifications, and open-source software to enable users to build, configure, and operate a microfluidic device. The authors use Metafluidics to share designs and fabrication instructions for both a microfluidic ring-mixer device and a 32-channel tabletop microfluidic controller. This device and controller are applied to build genetic circuits using standard DNA assembly methods including ligation, Gateway, Gibson, and Golden Gate. Metafluidics is intended to enable a broad community of engineers, DIY enthusiasts, and other nontraditional participants with limited fabrication skills to contribute to microfluidic research.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>summary: The rise of Free and Open Source models for software development has catalyzed the growth of Free and Open Source hardware (also known as “Libre Hardware”). Libre Hardware is gaining significant traction in the scientific hardware community, where there is evidence that open development creates both technically superior and far less expensive scientific equipment than proprietary models. In this article, the evidence is reviewed and a collection of examples of business models is developed to service scientists who have the option to manufacture their own equipment using Open Source designs.&lt;/p>
