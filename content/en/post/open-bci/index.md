[OpenBCI](https://openbci.com/) is a complete open source EEG system that can be built either on top of an Arduino (8-bit system), or on top of chipKIT (32-bit system), which gives the system more local memory and allows for faster speeds.

All software code and hardware (including a model for a 3D printable headset) plans can be found freely available at their [download section](https://openbci.com/index.php/downloads) or at [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBCI).
