summary: Channel Editor Summary: The authors have developed an open source and low-cost device for automated control of labelling and washing cells while under the microscope. This makes imaging it much easier to implement multiple step procedures for imaging at a high temporal and spatial resolution on any microscope with high reproducibility. The paper goes on to demonstrate very successful use in super-resolution imaging of actin bundles during cell-shape changes. The NanoJ-Fluidics device is built from LEGO components and nicknamed (of course) Pumpy McPumpface.
