summary: The potentiostat presented here from Prattana Lopin and Kyle V. Lopin can measure the presence of chemicals including vitamin C and lead without any external electronic components. It uses open source Pyhton code to programme a system on a chip device and requires only modest programming skills. The authors further encourage contributions of code for different applications to their Github repository.
