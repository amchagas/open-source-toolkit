summary: The classification of infections is a routine component of clinical management. Kameris is an open source toolkit for a supervised and alignment-free subtyping method which operates on HIV-1 sequences. Kameris is a software that has been written following best practices, is well tested and is released under the MIT License (MIT). In this article from Solis-Reyes et al, the accuracy and speed of the software is compared to four other well known pieces of software using a series of experiments. Both the experimental data and the software have been archived and are available on Github, making the work described in this academic paper 100% reproducible.
