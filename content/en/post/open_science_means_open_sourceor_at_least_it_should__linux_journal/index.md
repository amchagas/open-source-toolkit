summary: When did open source begin? In February 1998, when the term was coined by Christine Peterson? Or in 1989, when Richard Stallman drew up the "subroutinized" GNU GPL? Or perhaps a little earlier, in 1985, when he created the GNU Emacs license? In this piece,  Glynn Moody delves into the reluctance of some fields to embrace Open Science.
