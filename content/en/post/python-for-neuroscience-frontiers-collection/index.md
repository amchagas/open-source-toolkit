Frontiers has created not one but two nice collections about open source software for neurosciences written in Python.

[Here is collection 1](http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/8/python-in-neuroscience)

[Here is collection 2](http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/1591/python-in-neuroscience-ii)

In these collections the readers will find a lot of nice resources, ranging from stimulus generation, to data formatting and analysis.
