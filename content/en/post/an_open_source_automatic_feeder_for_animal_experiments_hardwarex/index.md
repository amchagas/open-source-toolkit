summary: This paper describes an open source experimental feeder using an Arduino microcontroller. The design of the feeder is focused on simplicity to provide a straight-forward building process and allow custom modifications for various requirements. The cost for building this feeder is less than â‚¬200 and has been tested with different food types for pigeons, cats, and marmoset monkeys.
