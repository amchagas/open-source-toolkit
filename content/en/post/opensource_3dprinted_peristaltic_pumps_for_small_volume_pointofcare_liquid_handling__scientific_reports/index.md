summary: Microfluidic technologies are frequently employed as point-of-care diagnostic tools for improving time-to-diagnosis and improving patient outcomes in clinical settings. These microfluidic devices often are designed to operate with peripheral equipment for liquid handling that increases the cost and complexity of these systems and reduces their potential for widespread adoption in low resource healthcare applications. In this work, Behrens et al present an open source peristaltic pump that can be constructed for around $120 using a combination of 3D- printed parts and common hardware.
