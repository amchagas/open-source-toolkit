summary: Channel Editor Summary: The paper describes a high speed camera system, capable of reaching frame rates of ~2300 frames per second in its max speed setting. Costing around 700 dollars, this system is quite affordable when compared to current commercial solutions and has the advantage of being standalone, which means it can work without a computer and it can potentially be powered by batteries, opening it up its use for a diverse range of fields. The system employs a black and white sensor, which makes it a good candidate for applications that require fluorescence detection. With good explanations on the rationale behind design decisions and a supporting repository, this paper is a good example on the amazing possibilities of Open Source Hardware for research.
