summary: This nifty device measures partial pressure of oxygen in a similar manner to commercial devices, yet at substantially reduced cost. In a nutshell, a sinusoidally modulated LED excites a luminescent dye over time, while a photodiode picks up the spectrally shifted emission light from the dye. Depending on the oxygen around the dye, this emission is phase-shifted, meaning that the oxygen partial pressure can be computed directly from this shift. The system is impressively accurate, and comes with a neat design that includes both a screen and WiFi capability, meaning that many devices can be built and read-out remotely.
