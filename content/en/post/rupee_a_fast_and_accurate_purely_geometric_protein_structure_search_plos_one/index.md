summary: Given the close relationship between protein structure and function, protein structure searches have long played an established role in bioinformatics. Despite their maturity, existing protein structure searches either use simplifying assumptions or compromise between fast response times and quality of results. To address these limitations the authors have developed RUPEE, a fast and accurate purely geometric structure search combining techniques from information retrieval and big data with a novel approach to encoding sequences of torsion angles.
