This project uses a 32X32 LED array (1024 LEDs in total) and a beagle bone black board. [The page describing the project](https://bikerglen.com/projects/lighting/led-panel-1up/) has very nice explanations on how the whole system works (and LED displays in general).




From this project, the creator [Glen Akins](https://twitter.com/bikerglen), went on to construct a 3X2 matrix of 32X32 LEDS, or a total of 6144 RGB LEDs that have a 200Hz refresh rate! Check out the video below of the panel in action:
