summary: Are you considering an open source alternative to standard videoconferencing software? Here, the author reviews some of the options such as Jitsi,  Jami, and Signal. He also outlines three key factors to consider when using these open source options. In particular he stresses the security of open source options but also warns that there will be trade offs between these tools and their commercial alternatives.
