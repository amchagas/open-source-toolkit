[Backyard brains](https://backyardbrains.com/) started out producing low cost, portable, electrophysiology systems to bring neuroscience to classrooms and help promote it. 


“Backyard brains wants to be for neuroscience, what the telescope is for astronomers” – meaning that the idea is that with a couple of hundred dollars anyone can get one of these recording systems and start doing experiments, like amateur astronomers can buy telescopes and start observing the cosmos.
