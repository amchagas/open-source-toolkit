The project overall aim is to provide cost efficient solution to drive microfluidics systems for e.g. cell culture and organ on a chip applications. Pumps, valves and other accessories are ofter expensive to buy or very expensive to custom made. The 8-channel FAST pump is a 3D printed pump that uses some off the shelf parts (steel pins and ball bearings) and is easily fabricated and assembled. A step by step protocol is published (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067220300249). The link to the picture is from this publication. The pump is far cheaper and smaller  than commercial pumps and still has at least as good as or better pump performance. The 8-channel pump is excellent for use in parallel cell culture applications.
