[NeuroMorpho.Org](http://neuromorpho.org/index.jsp) is a centrally curated inventory of **digitally reconstructed neurons** associated with peer-reviewed publications. It contains contributions from over 100 laboratories worldwide and is continuously updated as new morphological reconstructions are collected, published, and shared. (taken from neuromorpho.org)
