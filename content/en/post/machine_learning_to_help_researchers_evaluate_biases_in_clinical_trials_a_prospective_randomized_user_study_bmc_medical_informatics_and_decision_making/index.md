summary: Assessing risks of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is an important but laborious task when conducting systematic reviews. RobotReviewer (RR), an open-source machine learning (ML) system, semi-automates bias assessments. The authors conducted a user study of RobotReviewer, evaluating time saved and usability of the tool.
