summary: While open sourcing has become de rigueur in genomics dry labs, wet labs remain beholden to commercial instrument providers that rarely open source hardware or software, and impose draconian restrictions on instrument use and modification. With a view towards joining others who are working to change this state of affairs, the authors have posted a new preprint in which they describe an open source syringe pump and microscope system called poseidon.
