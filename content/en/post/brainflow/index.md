[BrainFlow](https://brainflow.ai/) BrainFlow is a library intended to obtain, parse and analyze EEG, EMG, ECG and other kinds of data from biosensors, it provides two APIs:



* Data Acquisition API to obtain data from BCI boards
* Signal Processing API which is completely independent and can be used without Data Acquisition API

Both of these APIs are uniform for all supported boards, so it allows to write completely board agnostic code.

BrainFlow has bindings for:

* C++
* Python
* Java
* C#
* R

And provides almost the same API for all languages above.
