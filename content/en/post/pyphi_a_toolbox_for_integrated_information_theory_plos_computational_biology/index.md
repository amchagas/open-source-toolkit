summary: Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, the authors introduce PyPhi, a Python software package that implements this framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete dynamical systems of binary elements.
