summary: In a nice example of adapting an existing tool, Daniel F.Carlson and Søren Rysgaard used OS control boards for Drones and its respective software as dataloggers to measure Iceberg characteristics (eg movement speed, orientation over time). The system is orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional counter parts and transmits data at a higher frequency.
