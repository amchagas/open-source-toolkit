Culture Shock is an open-source electroporator that was developed
through internet based collaboration, starting on the DIYbio Google
Group. It is an evolution on the traditional capacitive discharge
circuit topology, instead using pulsed induction to enable a
programmable waveform as well as reduce the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment. With all these benefits, we hope to reduce the burden
of laboratory consumables for DNA transformation and electrofusion
procedures, where chemical supplies are currently relied on. The added
benefit of programmability allows many cell types to be manipulated by
altering the voltage level, or even giving the voltage profile a
particular shape.
