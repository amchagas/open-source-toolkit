SciDraw is a free repository of high quality drawings of animals, scientific setups, and anything that might be useful for scientific presentations and posters. 
We want this repository to be as open as possible, so do not require signing up to post a drawing. This however means that you won't be able to edit your drawings after submission, so upload carefully! 
The drawings on SciDraw are made by and for scientists. You are free to download, modify and use all drawings on the website.
