[The openEEG](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html) project aims at describing and putting manuals for building a two channel EEG system for about U$200.
More on instructions on how to build one, can be found [here](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/SimpleEEG/).

The latest update on the page seems to be a bit old, but Olimex sells the necessary PCB boards and accessories to [build the device](https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/). They also sell the [openEEG completely assembled](https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/EEG-SMT/open-source-hardware).
