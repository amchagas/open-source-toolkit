Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species. 

Model structure and parameters can be automatically visualized and their dynamical properties explored through browser-based simulations. 

Infrastructure and tools for collaborative interaction, development, and testing are also provided.
