summary: Channel Editor Summary: PyLandStats is a fantastic example of an open source scientific package, with an open licence (GPL), clear documentation for both users and developers, and a source code repository set up to easily enable contributions and bug reports. In their paper the authors provide not only the source code, but also a set of Jupyter notebook examples, and they clearly cite the open data used in these notebooks.
