summary: eNeuro announce a new type of paper to provide a venue to share open-source tools and methods. Introducing this new type of papers offers several advantages: reducing the time and money laboratories spend to reinvent methods; increasing transparency; and improving reproducibility. As importantly, it allows for acknowledgment of those who developed such tools and methods fully, often rotating students or engineers recruited on a short-duration contract. On a standard research paper, their name ends up in the middle of the list of authors, but the Open Source Tools and Methods type will allow them to be the first author.
