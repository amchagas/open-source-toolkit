summary: This paper presents a useful open-source Microplate Photoirradiation System (MPS) for use in standard 96- and 24-well microplates that allows photobiologists to conduct a variety of experiments in a high-throughput format, inlcuding inside incubators. It has great potential for a wide range of assays and the authors provide extensive validation data.
