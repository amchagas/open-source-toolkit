[NeuroTinker project](https://hackaday.io/project/3339-neurons-neurons-neurons) is all about hardware emulated neurons. The creators made them in a way that each hardware neuron has excitatory and inhibitory inputs and one output that can be split up to affect dowsntream neurons. They are also cheap enough so that one can build several of them and wire them together to see which properties will emerge in the system. Design files are available on the [project's GitHub organization](https://github.com/neurotinker)
