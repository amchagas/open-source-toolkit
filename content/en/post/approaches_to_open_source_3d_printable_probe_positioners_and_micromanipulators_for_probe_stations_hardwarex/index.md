summary: This review of micromanipulator designs from Iiro Hietanen et al puts three open source alternatives through their paces with rigorous experimental testing, and explains the trade-off and decisions in weighing up cost and precision. It is a great example of a lab providing external validation of open science hardware designs from other groups, as is necessary in a collaborative open source community to foster robust designs and informed decision making.
