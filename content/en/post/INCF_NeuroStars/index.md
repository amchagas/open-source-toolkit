Neurostars is an open source question and answer site that serves the INCF network and the global neuroscience community as a forum for knowledge exchange between neuroscience researchers at all levels of expertise, software developers, and infrastructure providers. Access to Neurostars is free to the neuroscience community thanks to the generous support of our sponsors.

Neurostars is a forum for research questions, software, infrastructure, scientific societies, and virtual courses, including: 
* Software developers and infrastructure providers in need of a mechanism in which to engage and provide support to user communities and those in need of a platform to integrate tutorials and discussion forums (via INCF TrainingSpace)
* Scientific societies in need of a forum for knowledge exchange and support between members
* Virtual course organizers in need of an archivable Q & A forum to support learning in their courses where access can be restricted to registered participants with automated notifications and the ability to have multiple, linked subdiscussion groups
* Individuals in need of sharing ideas, asking questions and finding answers, and helping others within neuroscience without any cost
