[PySpace](https://pyspace.github.io/pyspace/) is a signal processing and classificiation environment for Python.


Modular software for processing of large data streams that has been specifically designed to enable distributed execution and empirical evaluation of signal processing chains. Various signal processing algorithms are available within the software, from finite impulse response filters over data-dependent spatial filters (e.g. CSP, xDAWN) to established classifiers (e.g. SVM, LDA). pySPACE incorporates the concept of node and node chains of the Modular Toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) framework.
