summary: In 1962 LMB researchers won a Nobel Prize for using x-ray crystallography to decipher the first atomic structures for proteins. One of LMB's most recent Nobel laureates, Richard Henderson, helped to develop cryo-EM a technique that bypasses the difficult process of forming crystals from proteins. But cryo-EM is a difficult and expensive process. This  news piece from Science reports on efforts to automate, improve and democratise the technique.
