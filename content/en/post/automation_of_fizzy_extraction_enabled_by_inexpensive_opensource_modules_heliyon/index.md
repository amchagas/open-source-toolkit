summary: Channel Editor Summary: This paper by Yang, Chang and Urban presents an automated system for preparing and analysing chemical components using fizzy extraction. Based on Arduino and other breakout boards, the system can be integrated to commercially available mass spectrometers, and outputs data in digital, as well as printed format. It can be controlled using a joystick or via smartphone app. It is a nice addition to open source hardware projects dealing with automation and increasing throughput in the lab.
