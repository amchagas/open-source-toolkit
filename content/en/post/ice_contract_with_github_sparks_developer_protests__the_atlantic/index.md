summary: With 37 million users, GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world. Much of the code hosted on GitHub is open source, meaning it’s accessible, shareable, and modifiable to anyone. Developers join the platform, download one another’s code, then collaborate, improve it, and tweak it for their own projects. When the details of GitHub’s contract with Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (ICE) caused significant backlash it highlighted an important question about the nature of open source. If you restrict access to open-source code, is it still open?
