summary: Computational models are powerful tools for exploring the properties of complex biological systems. In neuroscience, data-driven models of neural circuits that span multiple scales are increasingly being used to understand brain function in health and disease. But their adoption and reuse has been limited by the specialist knowledge required to evaluate and use them. To address this, the authors have developed Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species.
