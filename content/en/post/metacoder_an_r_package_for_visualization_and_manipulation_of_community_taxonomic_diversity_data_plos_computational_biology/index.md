summary: Community-level data, the type generated by an increasing number of metabarcoding studies, is often graphed as stacked bar charts or pie graphs that use color to represent taxa. These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, the authors developed metacoder, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data.
