summary: Biological data analysis is the key to new discoveries in disease biology and drug discovery. The rapid proliferation of high-throughput ‘omics’ data has necessitated a need for tools and platforms that allow the researchers to combine and analyse different types of biological data and obtain biologically relevant knowledge. Here, the authors describe the newly modelled biological data types and the enhanced visual and analytical features of TargetMine. These examples have demonstrated how the newer enhancements in TargetMine have contributed to a more expansive coverage of the biological data space and can help interpret genotype–phenotype relations.
