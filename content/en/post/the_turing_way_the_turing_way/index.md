summary: The Turing Way is a lightly opinionated guide to reproducible data science. The goal of The Turing Way is to provide all the information that researchers need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce at the end. This also means making sure PhD students, postdocs, PIs and funding teams know which parts of the “responsibility of reproducibility” they can affect, and what they should do to nudge data science to being more efficient, effective and understandable.
