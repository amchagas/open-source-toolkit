summary: 'bigPint is a software package for interactive and static data visualisation in R. It scales comfortably to large datasets, sporting graphs that include scatterplots, violin plots, and litre plots. It’s installable via <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bigPint.html">Bioconductor</a>, and as an open source project it also provides an easy-to-use <a href="https://lindsayrutter.github.io/bigPint/">landing</a> page that summarises all the links a new user or developer might wish to find, from “getting started”, to source code url, package version, maintenance status, example use-case code, supported R version, author contact details and bug reporting.
