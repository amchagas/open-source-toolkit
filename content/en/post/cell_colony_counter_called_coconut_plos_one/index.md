summary: CoCoNut removes the need for slow and eye-straining manual counting of viable colonies under a microscope. It's a semi-automated, image-based cell colony counting setup that combines 3D-printed hardware and an ImageJ plugin. The authors demonstrated the method with two cell types and successfully distinguished colonies. Of note is their approach to calibration which was specifically designed to be user-friendly and robust.
