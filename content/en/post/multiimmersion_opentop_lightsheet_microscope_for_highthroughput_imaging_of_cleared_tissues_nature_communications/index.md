summary: Recent advances in optical clearing and light-sheet microscopy have provided unprecedented access to structural and molecular information from intact tissues. However, current light-sheet microscopes have imposed constraints on the size, shape, number of specimens, and compatibility with various clearing protocols. In this paper the authors present a multi-immersion open-top light-sheet microscope that enables simple mounting of multiple specimens processed with a variety of clearing protocols, which will facilitate wide adoption by preclinical researchers and clinical laboratories.
