[DremelFuge](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1483) is a very simple and clever centrifuge, buit perhaps not the safest one (be careful if you end up using it!).

It takes advantage of 3d printing technology to print an adaptor that goes on to a Dremel (a precision tool that has really high rotation rates). It was created by [Cathal](https://www.thingiverse.com/cathalgarvey/about)
