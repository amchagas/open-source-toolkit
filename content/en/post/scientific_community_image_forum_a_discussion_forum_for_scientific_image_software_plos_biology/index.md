summary: Channel Editor Summary: In open source software, open code and free software is only the tip of the iceberg. Successful open source projects tend to have strong communities supporting both contributors as well as users - but this often comes with the hidden cost in volunteer (or staff) time and resources. The Scientific Community Image Forum helps to mitigate this concern by creating a single common forum for scientific imaging software that spans many domains and open source projects, and provides imaging software users with access to a broad range of experts.
