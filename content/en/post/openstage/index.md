[Open stage](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0088977) is a low-cost motorised microscope stage capable of movement in the micrometer range. 


It features manual control via a control-pad, different movement velocities and pc communication through the serial port. 


The authors also state that due to its simplicity, the system could be used to drive micromanipulators and other devices
