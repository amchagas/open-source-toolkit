summary: The use of implants that are specificaly designed for each patient is currently bounded to the use of expensive software or by the use of open source alternatives that are time consuming and labour intensive. The authors present an extension to MeVisaLab, an image processing suite focused on medical imaging. Their extension aims at semi-automatising the procedure of generating custom implants by emplying preset methods that can be tuned by the user.
