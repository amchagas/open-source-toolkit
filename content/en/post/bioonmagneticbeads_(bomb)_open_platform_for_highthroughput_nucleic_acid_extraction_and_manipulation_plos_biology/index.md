summary: Channel Editor Summary: Open-source, scalable and high-throughput protocols for purifying DNA and RNA using magnetic beads are presented, providing easy to use methods for some of the most common processes in molecular biology. The authors include detailed comparisons to other methods and extremely in-depth documentation to enable researchers to use and build upon the protocols plus a webpage and forum for community engagement. This paper provides a blueprint for documenting open source biology projects.
