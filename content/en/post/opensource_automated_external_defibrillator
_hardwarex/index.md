summary: The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a medical device that analyzes a patientâ€™s electrocardiogram in order to establish whether he/she is suffering from the fatal condition of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA), and subsequently allows the release of a therapeutic dose of electrical energy (i.e. defibrillation). Computer simulations and preliminary tests show that the OAED can release a 200 J biphasic defibrillation in about 12 s and detects SCA with sensitivity higher than 90% and specificity of about 99%.
