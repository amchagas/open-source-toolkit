summary: 'Channel Editor Summary: Have you ever wondered what proteins look like? In fact, accurately conceptualizing 3D protein structures is vital to both scientific research and education. ProteinVR is a free web-based application that works on various virtual reality (VR) setups and operating systems. ProteinVR displays molecular structures within 3D environments that give useful biological context and allow users to situate themselves in 3D space. ProteinVR is a promising tool, and its source code is hosted on GitLab with some exceptional instruction on installing ProteinVR on your own computer.
