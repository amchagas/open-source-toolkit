DeepLabStream is a python based multi-purpose tool that enables the realtime tracking of animals and manipulation of experiments. Our toolbox is adapted from the previously published DeepLabCut (Mathis et al., 2018) and expands on its core capabilities. DeepLabStreams core feature is the real-time analysis using any type of camera-based video stream (incl. multiple streams). Building onto that, we designed a full experimental closed-loop toolkit. It enables running experimental protocols that are dependent on a constant stream of bodypart positions and feedback activation of several input/output devices. It's capabilities range from simple region of interest (ROI) based triggers to headdirection or behavior dependent stimulation.
