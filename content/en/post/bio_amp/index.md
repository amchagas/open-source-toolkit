BioAmp is a biopotential acquisition device (EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, etc.) developed in the Prototyping Laboratory at the School of Engineering of the National University of Entre Rios (Argentina).

Main features:

    8 independent acquisition channels
    24 bits of resolution per channel
    2000 Hz is the maximum sampling frequency
    USB connection (power and data transmission)
    inputs for trigger signal
    designed under electrical safety standards for medical use (electrical insulation, touch-proof connectors, etc.)

A very interesting feature of the BioAmp is the possibility of combining two amplifiers to double the number of recording channels. It is also possible to program each channel individually, offering the possibility of registering different types of signal simultaneously. For example, EEG, EOG, and EMG could be recorded during a sleep study, or EMG and ECG during a physical activity study, etc.

This project is currently in evolution and development, continually changes and updates are made to improve the product. Both the hardware source files (PCB and cabinet for 3D printing) and firmware are available in the project repository.
