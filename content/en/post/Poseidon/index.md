The Poseidon is an open-source syringe pump and microscope system. It uses 3D printed parts and common components that can be easily purchased. It can be used in microfluidics experiments or other applications. You can assemble it in a short-time for under $400. The system is modular and highly customizable. Examples of applications are: control the chemical environment of a bioreactor, purify proteins and precisely add reagents to chemical reactions over time.
