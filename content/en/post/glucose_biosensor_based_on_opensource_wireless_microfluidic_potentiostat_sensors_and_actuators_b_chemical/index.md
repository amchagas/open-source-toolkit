summary: Wireless potentiostats capable of cyclic voltammetry and amperometry that connect to the Internet are emerging as key attributes of future point-of-care devices. This work presents an “integrated microfluidic electrochemical detector” (iMED) three-electrode multi-potentiostat designed around operational amplifiers connected to a powerful WiFi-based microcontroller as a promising alternative to more expensive and complex strategies reported in the literature.
