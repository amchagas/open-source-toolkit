summary: The ability to reliably and precisely deliver picolitre volumes is an important component of biological research. The authors describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. Due to its high performance and low cost, Openspritzer will likely be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.
