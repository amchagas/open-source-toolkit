summary: BornAgain is a free and open-source multi-platform software framework for simulating and fitting X-ray and neutron reflectometry, off-specular scattering, and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS). This paper gives a broad overview of the BornAgain project as per release 1.16 , it reviews extant software, and presents BornAgain along with an analysis of its requirements.
