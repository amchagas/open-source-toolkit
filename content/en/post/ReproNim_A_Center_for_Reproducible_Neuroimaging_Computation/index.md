ReproNim's goal is to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national investment in neuroimaging research, while making the process easier and more efficient for investigators.

ReproNim delivers a reproducible analysis framework comprised of components that include: 1) data and software discovery; 2) implementation of standardized description of data, results and workflows; 3) development of execution options that facilitates operation in all computational environments; 4) 
provision of training and education to the community.

All components of the framework are intended to foster continued use and development of the reproducible and generalizable framework in neuroimaging research.
