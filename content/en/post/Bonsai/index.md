Bonsai is a high-performance, easy to use, and flexible visual programming language for designing closed-loop neuroscience experiments combining physiology and behaviour data.

Bonsai has allowed scientists with no previous programming experience to quickly develop their own experimental rigs and is also being increasingly used as a platform to integrate new open-source hardware and software from the experimental neuroscience community.
