summary: This software article presents "https://github.com/MathOnco/EvoFreq">EvoFreq<, a comprehensive tool to visualise the evolutionary and population frequency dynamics of clones at a single point in time or as population frequencies over time using a variety of informative methods. The software builds on other methods of expands substantially on previous means of visualizing the clonal, temporal dynamics and offers users a range of options for displaying their sequence or model data.
