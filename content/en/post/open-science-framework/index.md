From the [Open science framework](http://openscienceframework.org/) webpage:

> The Open Science Framework (OSF) is part network of research materials, part version control system, and part collaboration software. The purpose of the software is to support the scientist&#8217;s workflow and help increase the alignment between scientific values and scientific practices.&nbsp;

The project offers cloud space for uploading of project outline, materials, workflow, individual contributions and their extent to a specific project. All of that with the option of having all data publicly or privately available. The idea is to allow a more transparent and innovative system where people can see what is being done in &#8220;real-time&#8221;, contribute and even take up on ideas from other people so that the wheel doesn&#8217;t have to be reinvented, the system also allows for proper citation, so that the &#8220;wheel inventors&#8221; won&#8217;t go uncredited.

As an example of what can be done through the Open Science Framework, one can cite the [Reproducibility Project](http://openscienceframework.org/project/EZcUj/wiki/home) which is a project that aims at checking the reproducibility of ~150 sample studies from cognitive and psychological sciences. Contributors are welcomed!
