summary: In order to measure what happens to samples while being centrifuged, the authors created an adaptor that combines electronics and 3D printed parts
to measure in real time how concentration changes along a tube containing samples, allowing protocol optimization. Additionally the software transmits and records data automatically and is able to turn off the centrifuge once a threshold is reached.
