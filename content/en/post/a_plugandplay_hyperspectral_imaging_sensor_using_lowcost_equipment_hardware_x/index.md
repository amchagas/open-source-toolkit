summary: Hyperspectral Imaging Sensors (HSI) obtain spectral information from an object, and they are used to solve problems in Remote Sensing, Food Analysis, Precision Agriculture, and others. This paper took advantage of modern high-resolution cameras, electronics, and optics to develop a robust, low-cost, and easy to assemble HSI device. This device could be used to evaluate new algorithms for hyperspectral image analysis and explore its feasibility to develop new applications on a low-budget.
