NeuroImaging Tools & Resources Collaboratory is an award-winning free web-based resource that offers comprehensive information on an ever expanding scope of neuroinformatics software and data. Since debuting in 2007, NITRC has helped the neuroscience community make further discoveries using software and data produced from research that used to end up lost or disregarded. 

NITRC also provides free access to data and enables pay-per-use cloud-based access to unlimited computing power, enabling worldwide scientific collaboration with minimal startup and cost. NITRC’s scientific focus includes: MR, PET/SPECT, CT, EEG/MEG, optical imaging, clinical neuroimaging, computational neuroscience, and imaging genomics software tools, data, and computational resources.

With NITRC and its components—the Resources Registry (NITRC-R), Image Repository (NITRC-IR), and Computational Environment (NITRC-CE)—a researcher can obtain pilot or proof-of-concept data to validate a hypothesis for just a few dollars.
