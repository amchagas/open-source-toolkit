summary: Modern microscopes allow us to acquire high quality external images of biological specimens, however, these can only be obtained at the very surface of the specimen.  Delving deeper into the biological tissues results in a decreased quality image due to light scattering by the tissues’ cells. Weigert et al present an open source software package called biobeam to address the issue by simulating how microscopes record images deep inside scattering biological samples. The development of biobeam follows several best practice software approaches, such as modularization and automated testing.  These do not only reflect on the correctness of their results but also on the flexibility to contribute and implement further features in biobeam.
