summary: VorteX is a graphical tool for cluster analysis of multiparametric datasets in biology, especially single-cell data. It provides multithreaded implementations of clustering algorithms, including nonparametric density-based X-shift, Hierarchical clustering, Mean-shift and K-medoids. VorteX is designed to empower researchers' exploration of biological data by providing and easy-to-use environment for cluster analysis and rich visualization of clustering results.
