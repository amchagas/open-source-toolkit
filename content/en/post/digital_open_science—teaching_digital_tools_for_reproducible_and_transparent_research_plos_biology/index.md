summary: An important hallmark of science is the transparency and reproducibility of scientific results. Over the last few years, internet-based technologies have emerged that allow for a representation of the scientific process that goes far beyond traditional methods and analysis descriptions. Using these often freely available tools requires a suite of skills that is not necessarily part of a curriculum in the life sciences. To close this gap, Toelch and Ostwald have designed an introductory course that guides students towards a reproducible science workflow. This paper outlines the course content and possible extensions, report encountered challenges, and discuss how to integrate such a course in existing curricula.
