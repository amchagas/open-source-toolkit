From the [Pearce lab](http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~pearce/Index.html), this syringe pump was [published in Plos One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107216) and is built using 3d printed parts, stepper motors and a raspberry pi, costing 5% or less than commercial available systems. Can be calibrated and customized for different applications.
