summary: Lab On The Cheap have"http://www.labonthecheap.com/index.php/2018/04/10/technical-tuesday-economical-electrophoresis/"> written about Gel Electrophoresis before<, the punchline of which was that 
"https://www.minipcr.com/product/bluegel-electrophoresis-with-built-in-illuminator/">MiniPCR has good gel electrophoresis and imaging system for just $350<. However, that system is for blue light. If you are trying to image faint bands of DNA stained with ethidium bromide you need a light source on the low end of 300 nm. There aren’t equivalently cheap UV transilluminators, they average $2000 for the most basic models, but here’s what we know of for cheaper solutions.
