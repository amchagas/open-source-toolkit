Many excellent brain atlases exist for different species. Some of them have an API (application programming interface) to allow users to interact with the data programmatically (e.g. the excellent Allen Mouse Brain Atlas), but many do not, and there is no consistent way to process data from multiple sources.

The brainglobe atlas API (BG-AtlasAPI) deals with this problem by providing a common interface for programmers to download and process atlas data from multiple sources.
