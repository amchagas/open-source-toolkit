The open-source optical toolbox UC2 [YouSeeToo] simplifies the process of building optical setups, by combining 3D-printed cubes, each holding a specific component (e.g. lens, mirror) on a magnetic square-grid baseplate. The use of widely available consumables and 3D printing, together with documentation and software, offers an extremely low-cost and accessible alternative for both education and research areas. In order to reduce the entry barrier, we provide a fully comprehensive toolbox called TheBOX. A paper describing the scientific application in detail can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.973073v1).
