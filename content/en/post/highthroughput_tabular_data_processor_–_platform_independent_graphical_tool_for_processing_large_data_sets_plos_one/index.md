summary: High-throughput technologies generate considerable amount of data which often requires bioinformatic expertise to analyze. Here, Ptior Madanecki et al present High-Throughput Tabular Data Processor (HTDP), a platform independent Java program. HTDP works on any character-delimited column data (e.g. BED, GFF, GTF, PSL, WIG, VCF) from multiple text files and supports merging, filtering and converting of data that is produced in the course of high-throughput experiments.
