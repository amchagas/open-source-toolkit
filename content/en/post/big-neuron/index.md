Big Neuron wants to create a standard for the field of single neuron reconstruction. Because the data available comes from different structures, different organisms, using different collection and analyses algorithms and is in the range of petabytes (according to the project site), there is a strong need for standards that will allow this huge amount of data to be compared.

The project aims to develop a common platform and algorithms for data analysis to benchmark as many open source neuronal reconstruction models as possible.
