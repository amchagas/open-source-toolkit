Open Ephys is a great initiative to create a suite that encompasses hardware for LFP and spiking recording, optogenetics combined with custom written software for microstimulation, environmental stimuli, extracellular recording and optogen. perturbations. Their ultimate goal is to create a system optimized for tetrodes and optogenetics where one is able to record and analyse data in real-time. On the [project’s website](http://www.open-ephys.org/) one can download plans on how to build the devices and estimate on part cost (which is much, much lower than commercially available systems out there).
