summary: The paper describes a €100 portable and neurogenetics lab. Built with off the shelf components and 3D printed parts it is a versatile tool that due to its modular design can be useful in different fields. So far proof-of-principle experiments show that it can be used for neuroscience research, medical diagnostics and education.
