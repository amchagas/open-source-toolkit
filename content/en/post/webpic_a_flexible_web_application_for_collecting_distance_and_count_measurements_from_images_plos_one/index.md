summary: Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. In this paper, Lucy M. Chang introduces the framework of webpic, an open-source web application which implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline this process, and demonstrates one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens.
