summary: To lower the barrier to entry and provide the best options when aiming to 3D print an anatomical model from medical images, the authors provide an overview of relevant free and open-source image segmentation tools as well as 3D printing technologies. This demonstrates the utility of a streamlined workflow by creating models of ribs, liver, and lung using a Fused Deposition Modelling 3D printer.
