Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. Your notebooks get stored on Google Drive. The great advantage is that you donâ€™t have to install anything (however, for some features you need a Google account) on your system to use it. You can perform specific computations during data analysis with pre-installed Python libraries and gives you access to accelerated hardware for free (e.g. GPUs and TPUs).
