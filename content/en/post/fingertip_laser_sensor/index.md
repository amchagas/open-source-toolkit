[The fingertip laser project](http://toychest.ai.uni-bremen.de/wiki/projects:fingertip#fingertip_laser_sensor) makes use of the sensor used in an Avago ADNS-9500 laser mouse, to improve the capabilities of robotic hands, giving them the capability to detect distance, surface type and slippage of grasped objects. Very elegant hack of a mouse sensor!
