MorphoPy is an open software package written in Python3 that allows for visualization and processing of morphological reconstructions of neural data. It has been created to facilitate the translation from morphology graphs into descriptive features like density maps, morphometric statistics, and persistence diagrams for down-stream exploration and statistical analysis.
