summary: Channel Editor Summary: Fiber photometry allows researchers to record neural activity by measuring changes in fluorescence of chemical indicators using an optical fibre and is a powerful technique that is currently quite expensive to perform. The platform presented in this paper integrates hardware with open source python software to deliver comparable functionality at lower cost and with the ability to adapt to a wide range of user requirements, opening up more tools for scientists investigating neural circuitry.
