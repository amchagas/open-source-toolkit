cellfinder is software from the Margrie Lab at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for automated 3D cell detection and registration of whole-brain images (e.g. serial two-photon or lightsheet imaging).

Itâ€™s a work in progress, but cellfinder can:

   - Detect labelled cells in 3D in whole-brain images (many hundreds of GB)
   - Register the image to an atlas (such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas)
   - Segment the brain based on the reference atlas
   - Calculate the volume of each brain area, and the number of labelled cells within it
   - Transform everything into standard space for analysis and visualisation
