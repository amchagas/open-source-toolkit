summary: Open source projects are nothing but a collaborative effort of community members. The constant involvement of  maintainers, contributors, and users make open source software sustainable and keeps the community as a whole going.  Attracting new members, retaining them, and helping them be productive is not always as easy task. “Ten simple rules for helping newcomers become contributors to open projects”, as stated in the title, discusses ten simple rules projects should follow to help new contributors into their communities.

If you are a new contributor interested in winning a t-shirt by making four pull requests and/or part of a project wanting to attract new members we recommend checking out "https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest< .
