[The Green Brain project](http://greenbrain.group.shef.ac.uk/) wants to create an artificial _Apis mellifera_ brain and implement said brain into a robot, that will be able to fly and and behave just like a honey bee!

The reasons for this project are:

* The bee brain has way less neurons than the brain of rodents (but still in the order of 10^6 neurons!), so understanding how this simple brain works could be a nice step towards understanding more complex brains.
* The bee population has been declining and scientists are not exactly sure why.
* Understanding bee behaviour and the organ that produces them might help solve the problem
* Improvement of unmanned aerial vehicle control
