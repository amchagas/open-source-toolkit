summary: Three co-creators of the MIT-incubated Julia programming language are the recipients of the 2019 James H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software. The prize will be awarded to Bezanson, Karpinski, and Shah “for the creation of Julia, an innovative environment for the creation of high-performance tools that enable the analysis and solution of computational science problems.”
