summary: This article discusses the current shortfalls of open source projects in inclusivity and diversity. In 2017 a GitHub open source survey found that 95% of respondents were male.  Yet open source tools could benefit if they better reflected the diversity present in the community using them. The article cites data from a "https://www.digitalocean.com/currents/december-2019/#anchor-the-community-of-open-source">Digital Ocean< survey that suggests reasons for the lack of diversity in the community.
