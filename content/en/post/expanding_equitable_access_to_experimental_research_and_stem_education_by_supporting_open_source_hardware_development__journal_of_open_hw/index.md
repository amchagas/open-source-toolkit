summary: Is there an opportunity to radically increase access to scientific instrumentation, while improving the quality and diversity of research tools by harnessing the power of collaborative innovation in the development of FOSH (free and open source hardware)? The authors propose that there is now a further opportunity to secure added value from FOSH for science using a network to network approach.
