JASP is a cross-platform statistical software program with a state-of-the-art graphical user interface. The JASP interface allows you to conduct statistical analyses in seconds, and without having to learn programming or risking a programming mistake. JASP is open-source and free of charge, and we provide it as a service to the community. JASP is statistically inclusive as it offers both frequentist and Bayesian analysis methods.
