summary: Releasing lab-built open-source software often involves a mountain of unforeseen work for the developers. Itâ€™s a familiar problem: open-source software is widely acknowledged as crucially important in science, yet it is funded non-sustainably. Scientists writing open-source software often lack formal training in software engineering, which means that they might never have learnt best practices for code documentation and testing. But poorly maintained software can waste time and effort, and hinder reproducibility.
