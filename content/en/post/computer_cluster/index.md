Here are two projects that use card sized computers as the basic units for computing clusters:

<br>

- A [64 node cluster](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sjc/raspberrypi/), build using pi’s and lego, built at the University of Southampton.
- [BeagleBone Black cluster](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/building-compute-cluster-beaglebone-black/) by [Dan Ricart](https://www.linux.com/author/mazdacardinal/)
