summary: Channel Editor Summary: The second paper in this pairing, describes an optical projection tomography (OPT) system for large transparent organ samples. Capable of imaging high volumes (up to 13mm tall X8mm deep) at near-cellular resolution (50µm), they go beyond current low cost OPT by providing more than one solution to sample alignment issues present in these tyoes of systems. On top of being a nice addition to the open hardware library, their system is built on top of existing open source tools, such as ImageJ and the Open Flexure stage, showing in practice one of the great benefits of open documentation and development.
