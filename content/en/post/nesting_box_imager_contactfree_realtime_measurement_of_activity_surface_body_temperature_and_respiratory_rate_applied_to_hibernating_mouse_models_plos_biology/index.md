summary: If you're trying to measure animal activity without disturbing a hibernating animal your options were previously limited and expensive but the growing utility and shrinking price of sensors, cameras and single-board computers has enabled this device for monitoring mice nesting boxes using a Raspberry Pi and an infrared camera for under $400. The authors demonstrate the use of contact-free measurement of respiration rate, movement and surface body temperature with data logging and processing (so long as the mouse doesn't block the camera with bedding!).
