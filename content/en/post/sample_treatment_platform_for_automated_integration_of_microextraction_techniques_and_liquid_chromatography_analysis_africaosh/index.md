summary: AfricaOSH is a gathering for everyone interested in Open Science & Hardware as a means to achieve locally adapted, culturally relevant, technologically and economically feasible production in Africa; as an alternative to traditional Intellectual Property (IP )and closed knowledge systems; and to understand its potential for development and collaboration across Africa, especially by reducing barriers to entry in education, research and manufacturing.
