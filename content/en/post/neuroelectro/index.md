[NeuroElectro](http://neuroelectro.org/) wants to extract information about neuron types, morphology, electrophysiology properties from papers, using text mining algorithms and gathers them in a database.

> Our goal is to facilitate the discovery of [neuron-to-neuron relationships](http://neuroelectro.org/neuroelectro/neuron/clustering) and better understand the role of functional diversity across neuron types.
