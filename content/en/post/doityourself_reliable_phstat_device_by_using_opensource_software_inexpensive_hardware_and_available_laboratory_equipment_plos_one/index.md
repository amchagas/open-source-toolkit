summary: Milanovic et al present the construction of a reliable and inexpensive pH stat device allowing closed loop monitoring and control of pH using open-source, low-cost and/or readily available laboratory devices. Their methodology for the design, development and test results of each part of the device, as well as of the entire system, is a good example for other developers of open science hardware and the cost of <150 EUR opens up opportunities for more scientists to improve the automation and reproducibility of their experiments.
