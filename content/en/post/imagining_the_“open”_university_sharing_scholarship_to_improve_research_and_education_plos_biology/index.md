summary: Open scholarship, such as the sharing of articles, code, data, and educational resources, has the potential to improve university research and education as well as increase the impact universities can have beyond their own walls. The author proposes several concrete actions universities could take to support open scholarship and outline ways in which such initiatives could benefit the public as well as institutions.
