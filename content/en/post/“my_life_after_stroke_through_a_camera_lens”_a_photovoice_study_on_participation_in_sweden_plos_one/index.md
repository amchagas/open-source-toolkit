summary: An increasing number of people with stroke live in their communities, yet the understanding of how their reintegration into society can best be facilitated is incomplete. If needs are not sufficiently met and difficulties overcome, it may result in limited participation and decreased life satisfaction for this group. The authors aimed to understand life after stroke through the lens of participants’ cameras, and hence their views and experiences guided this study.
