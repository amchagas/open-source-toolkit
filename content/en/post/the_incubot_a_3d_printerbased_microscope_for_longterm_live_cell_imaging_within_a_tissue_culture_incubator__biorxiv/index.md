summary: 'Commercial live cell imaging systems represent a large financial burden to research groups, while current open source incubator microscopy systems lack adaptability and are sometimes inadequate for complex imaging experimentation. Here, Merces <i>et al</i> present a low-cost microscope designed for inclusion within a conventional tissue culture incubator. The build is constructed using an entry level 3D printer as the basis for the motion control system, with Raspberry Pi imaging and software integration, allowing for reflected, oblique, and fluorescence imaging of live cell monolayers. The open source nature of the design is aimed to facilitate adaptation by both the community at large and by individual researchers/groups. '
