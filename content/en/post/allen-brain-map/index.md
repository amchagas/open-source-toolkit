[The Brain Map](http://www.brain-map.org/) is one of the initiatives of the [Allen Institute](http://www.alleninstitute.org/about/).

It is a data portal that encompasses different projects:

> the Allen Institute has created a set of large-scale programs to understand the fundamentals of the cortex. We will be focusing our understanding through simultaneous study of the brain's  components, computation and cognition.</a>
>
> the Allen Institute has produced a collection of open science resources that give users a powerful way to explore gene expression data, neural connections, single cell characterization and neuroanatomy. All of our resources are openly accessible via the Allen Brain Atlas data portal.
