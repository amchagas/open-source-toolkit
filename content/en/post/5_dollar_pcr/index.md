The 5 dollar PCR machine is a project from [David Ng](https://hackaday.io/dnhkng).

he created a very interesting design for the PCR machine. Instead of using eppendorfs, he is using teflon tubes and three different heating elements, which allows for cheaper (he has a working PCR machine for 5 dollars!) and faster DNA amplifications.

[Here you can find the project page, with nice description and instructions](https://hackaday.io/project/1864-5-dna-replicator)

Below is a video from David explaining the project:
