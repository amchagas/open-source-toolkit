BrainBrowser is a collection of open source, web-based 3D data visualization tools, mainly for neuroimaging studies. It is built using open technologies such as WebGL and HTML5. It allows exploration of cortical surface models (MNI and Wavefront OBJ, as well as FreeSurfer ASCII surface format) and volumetric MINC data. This project is currently maintained by [Tarek Sherif](http://www.tareksherif.ca/) at McGill University, and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aces/brainbrowser).
