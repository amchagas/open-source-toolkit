With the rise of low cost 3D printers, and other cheap manufacturing tools, the field of robotics and prosthetics has been gaining quite a few open source projects. Two very nice compilations can be found at [openrobot hardware](//openrobothardware.org/) and at [Soft robotics toolkit](http://softroboticstoolkit.com/). Below are some related to neuroscience:
