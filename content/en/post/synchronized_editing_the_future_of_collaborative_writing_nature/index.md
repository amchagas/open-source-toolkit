summary: Draft scientific manuscripts tend to be confidential, however this article presents the approach of Olga Botvinnik who managed her paper like a piece of open-source software. She wrote it in a plain-text editor and placed text files alongside data sets and code for generating figures on the code-sharing site GitHub. She then invited her four co-authors to submit edits using Git, software that tracks precisely how and when a file has been changed.
