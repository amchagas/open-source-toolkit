summary: In this exciting design, the authors present a large-field of view fluorescence chamber for visualisation of, well, anything that fluoresceses. Using LEDs and low-cost acrylics the system is set-up to allow for convenient simultaneous imaging in multiple colours using an RGB camera. The main demonstration in the paper is for use with bacterial cultures, but the set-up should work for all manners of things. Perhaps this can double as a gel transilluminator? In hand, it comes with a handy set of software routines to analyse the data.
