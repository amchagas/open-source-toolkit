summary: High-speed synchronization of multiple devices is a necessity for modern optical microscopy techniques and this paper simplifies the process for those building custom microscope systems by providing a hardware control platform that reduces the need for custom software while expanding the scope of compatible peripheral devices. The authors give credit to related devices and clearly explain the benefits and limitations of their device while providing an excellent demonstration of use in two advanced forms of microscopy: total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM).
