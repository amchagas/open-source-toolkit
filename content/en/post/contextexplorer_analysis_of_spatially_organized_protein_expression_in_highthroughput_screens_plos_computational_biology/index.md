summary: Channel Editor's Summary: To many, open source software means “free to use”, and to others it might mean “I can see and re-use the code freely”. One way open source software can truly stand out, however, is by ensuring it’s welcoming and easy for newcomers to use and contribute to. Content-explorer is a python-based tool that provides a graphical interface to analyse data extracted from cell microscope images, and includes a high-quality readme, contribution guidance, and a code of conduct to ensure all contributors feel welcome and safe.
