summary: This design is a rig for high-throughput behavioural experiments with genetically amenable model species such as fruit flies. At its core, it is a webcam (RPi camera) focussed at a set of interchangable behavioural arena arrays for parallel recording of multiple aninals at once. Laden with a light zapper for optogenetics, and a nice networking interface for controlling multiple units from a remote computer this looks like a great tool for high throughput ethomics!
