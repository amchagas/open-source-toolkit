summary: Channel Editor Summary: The authors report on an open hardware separator for immiscible liquids like oil and water using porous tubing and a number of off-the-shelf components or DIY parts. The output fluid streams are monitored optically allowing optimisation of separation and it functions over a broad range of flow rates making it useful in a range of chemical and biochemical experiments. The technical diagrams, full parts list, assembly instructions, and source code for the firmware are all provided.
