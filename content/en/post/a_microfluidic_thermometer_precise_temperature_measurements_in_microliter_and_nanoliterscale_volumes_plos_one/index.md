summary: These authors took up the challenge of creating a thermometer for accurate measurements of biological and chemical samples on the microliter or nanoliter scale. Having an open source toolkit is increasingly important as microfluidics become more accessible and devices are designed and used by a growing number of researchers. This method uses a simple 3D-printed microfluidic chip and software tool which have been made openly available online. Temperature is a significant factor in many experiments and this paper provides a simple and precise way to monitor it in both research and educational laboratories.
