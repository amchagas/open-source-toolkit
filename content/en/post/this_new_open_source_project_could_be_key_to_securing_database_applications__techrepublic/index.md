summary: 'Moving database applications to the cloud has been a boon for development teams anxious to move faster. It has also, however, exposed security flaws inherent in traditional security solutions, something data layer security startup Cyral has been tackling. To take this a step further, Cyral recently open sourced a project called Approzium to enable developers to better observe and secure data by themselves. '
