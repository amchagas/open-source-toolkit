FastTrack is an open-source cross-platform tracking software. Easy to install and easy to use, it can track a large variety of systems from active particles to animals, with a known or unknown number of objects. It can process movies from any quality on low-end to high-end computers.

Two main features are implemented in the software:
    - A fast and automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects, conserving the objects' identities across the video recording.
    - A manual tool to review the tracking where errors can be corrected rapidly and easily to achieve 100% accuracy with a minimum of efforts.

FastTrack do not require coding abilities to be used. A developer documentation is available for users who want to embed FastTrack tracking algorithm directly inside their projects.
