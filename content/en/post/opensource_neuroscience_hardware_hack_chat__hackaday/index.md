summary: 'This article was written to promote the OPEN-SOURCE NEUROSCIENCE HARDWARE HACK CHAT that took place in February 2020, a transcript of which is available <a href=https://hackaday.io/event/169511-open-source-neuroscience-hardware-hack-chat/log/174068-hack-chat-transcript-part-1"">here</a>.  The event was hosted by Lex Kravitz and Mark Laubach, neuroscientists that are leveraging open hardware to gain access to the highly specialized tools they need for their work. This includes everything from <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/167972-mouse-brain-matrix">simple jigs for brain sectioning</a> to full <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/106885-feeding-experimentation-device-3-fed3">feeding systems for rodent cages</a>.'
