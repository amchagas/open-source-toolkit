summary: Editors note: The article presents a toolbox for opto-mechanical pieces that are based on printable 3D models and commercially available parts; each piece is tested for stability and precision and compared to pieces from well-known manufacturers. The results show that the toolbox designs have similar performance to the industrial ones. This paper shows in practice, and in a straightforward manner, many of the benefits that can be reaped by the adoption of open source philosophy: customisation, cost-reduction, availability and democratisation of technology.
