summary: A low cost microscope kit "the other way round": instead of requiring the user to peer through eye-pieces, this design aligns a series of lenses around a sample plane and shines light through the centre to project the greatly magnified image onto a piece of paper that can be comfortably observed with the naked eye. Great for simplicity, flexibility and for demonstrations to larger audiences such as outreach projects or classrooms.
