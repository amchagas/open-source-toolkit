summary: The regulation of feeding plays a key role in determining the fitness of animals through its impact on nutrition. Elucidating the circuit basis of feeding and related behaviors is an important goal in neuroscience. In this preprint the authors describe the development and validation of this system, which they term the optoPAD. They use the optoPAD to induce appetitive and aversive effects on feeding by activating or inhibiting gustatory neurons in closed loop – effectively creating virtual taste realities.
