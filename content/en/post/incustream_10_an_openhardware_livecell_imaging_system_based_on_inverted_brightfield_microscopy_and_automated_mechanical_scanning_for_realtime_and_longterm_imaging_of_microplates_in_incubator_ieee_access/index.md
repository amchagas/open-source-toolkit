summary: Channel Editor Summary: The authors present a microplate-compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that
can be used inside incubators to monitor cell growth in real-time and under controlled conditions. They use off-the-shelf electronics components and a low-cost USB camera module with automation software so no user intervention is required. Images from tests with human cell lines, yeast and C. elegans make this a versatile piece of lab equipment with a reported component cost of only 184 USD.
