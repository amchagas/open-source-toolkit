summary: Visual neuroscientists require accurate control of visual stimulation. However, few stimulator solutions offer high spatio-temporal resolution and free control over the spectra of the light sources, because they rely on off-the-shelf technology developed for human trichromatic vision. Importantly, consumer displays fail to drive UV-shifted short wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors, which strongly contribute to visual behaviour in many animals, including mice, zebrafish and fruit flies. In this work, the authors present a flexible, spatial visual stimulator with up to six arbitrary spectrum chromatic channels.
