The Craniobot is a cranial microsurgery platform that combines automated skull surface profiling with a computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling machine to perform a variety of cranial microsurgical procedures in mice. The Craniobot utilizes a low force contact sensor to profile the skull surface and uses this information to perform micrometer-scale precise milling operations within minutes. The procedure of removing the sub-millimeter thick mouse skull precisely without damaging the underlying brain can be technically challenging and often takes significant skill and practice. This can now be overcome using the Craniobot.
