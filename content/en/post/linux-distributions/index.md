Linux is an open source operating system and it is the major OS used in servers and supercomputers.  [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), one of the best known distributions has been gaining space in the personal computing scene, now days already being factory [shipped](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/05/ubuntu-to-ship-on-5-of-all-pcs-sold-next-year) by major manufacturers.

But how practical is to migrate to a Linux distribution? Well, very. If one passes beyond the hassle of backing up data and installing a new OS, there are many advantages that come with it. For starters these OSs are safer than any Microsoft or Apple OS. There is a large community of users sharing solutions to problems, bugs and so on (there hasn&#8217;t been to today a widespread of any [malware through Linux systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_malware)). Being open source, the distributions are perfect for customization, something really useful for science labs.

A Small list of distributions that make a good starting point:

  * [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
  * [NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net/) (Debian oriented to neuroscience)
  * [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com)
  * [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/)
  * [OpenSuse](http://en.opensuse.org/Main_Page)
  * [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/)

[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) &#8211;
