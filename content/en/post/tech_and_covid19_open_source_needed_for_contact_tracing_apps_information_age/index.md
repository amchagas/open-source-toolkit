summary: The inevitable and necessary responses to COVID-19 from the lockdown itself, to the use of contact tracing apps raise concerns about our civil liberties that in a different time would all have been hotly debated over a considerable time period. Thanks to COVID-19, time is no longer a luxury at humanityâ€™s disposal. Here the author suggests that the best way to reassure the public that their privacy is adequately protected is to make contact tracing apps open source.
