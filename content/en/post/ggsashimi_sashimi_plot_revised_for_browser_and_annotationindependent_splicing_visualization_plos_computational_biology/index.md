summary: Garrido-Martín et al. present ggsashimi, a command-line tool for the visualization of splicing events across multiple samples. Given a specified genomic region, ggsashimi creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software.
