A very neat picospritzer initially created by Joe (PI at [Raimondo Lab](http://raimondolab.com/)) using basically a solenoid valve, microcontroller and a power source.

Was later further developed by [Chris](https://chrisjforman.com/) at the [Baden Lab](badenlab.org), and collaboratively published as [a peer reviewed article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02301-2).


Details on how to build it, can be found on the [project's Git repository](https://github.com/BadenLab/Openspritzer/).
