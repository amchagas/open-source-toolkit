summary: Although the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is an important assay for measuring neutralizing antibody responses against many viruses, no free, open-source programs specifically designed for virus plaque counting and neutralizing antibody titer estimation are available. As described here, Katzelnick et al have developed Viridot, a package for R with a user-interface in shiny, which is designed for use by laboratory-based virologists and researchers with minimal coding experience. The program includes: automatic and user-specification of settings for plaque counting; saving of plaque counting settings; counting of many plates at once; and easy output of plaque counts, plaque sizes, and images with counted plaques circled.
