Discovery and comparison of structures such as modular communities, rich clubs, hubs, and trees yield insight into the generative mechanisms and functional properties of the graph. Often, two graphs are compared via a pairwise distance measure, with a small distance indicating structural similarity and vice versa. Common choices include spectral distances and distances based on node affinities. However, no comparative study of the efficacy of these distance measures in discerning between common graph topologies at different structural scales has been presented. In this work, Wills and Meyer compare commonly used graph metrics and distance measures, and demonstrate their ability to discern between common topological features found in both random graph models and real world networks.\nauthors: Peter Wills, François G.

A key challenge in this is the composition and dimensionality of microbiome data. Additionally, the configuration of co-occurring taxa may represent overlapping subcommunities that contribute to sample characteristics such as host status. Preserving the configuration of co-occurring microbes rather than detecting specific indicator species is more likely to facilitate biologically meaningful interpretations.

Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. The authors developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts.

Several demonstrations were made successfully over fiber networks, but not much work has been done yet through the open air where atmospheric turbulence prevails. Here, the authors use an 18 km outdoor link to transmit multiple optical carriers extracted directly from a frequency comb of a 4.2 THz spectral width. In stabilization to a high-finesse cavity with a 1.5 Hz linewidth, the comb-rooted optical carriers are simultaneously transferred with collective suppression of atmospheric phase noise to −80 dBc Hz−1. Microwaves are also delivered by pairing two separate optical carriers bound with inter-comb-mode coherence, for example a 10 GHz signal with phase noise of −105 dBc Hz−1 at 1 Hz offset. Lastly, an add-on demonstration is given for multi-channel coherent optical communications with the potential of multi-Tbps data transmission in free space.\nauthors: Hyun Jay Kang, Jaewon Yang, Byung Jae Chun, Heesuk Jang, Byung Soo Kim, Young-Jin Kim \u0026amp; Seung-Woo Kim\nlink to paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12443-8\nIcons made by catkuro from www.flaticon.com\n","date":1571270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571270400,"objectID":"11bd287e951c3c5418a33b5f74b5d667","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/open-source-toolkit/post/freespace_transfer_of_combrooted_optical_frequencies_over_an_18-km_openair_link_nature_communications/","publishdate":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/open-source-toolkit/post/freespace_transfer_of_combrooted_optical_frequencies_over_an_18-km_openair_link_nature_communications/","section":"post","summary":"Publishing date: 2019-10-17\nPublished on: Nature Communications\nsummary: Phase-coherent transfer of optical frequencies over a long distance is required for diverse photonic applications, including optical clock dissemination and physical constants measurement.","tags":["Research Article","None","Nature Communications"],"title":"Free-space transfer of comb-rooted optical frequencies over an 18 km open-air link","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Publishing date: 2019-10-17\nPublished on: PLOS ONE\nsummary: Earth System Models (ESMs) are excellent tools for quantifying many aspects of future climate dynamics but are too computationally expensive to produce large collections of scenarios for downstream users of ESM data.

This scientific revolution, though evident to the research community, remains opaque to nonacademic audiences. Such knowledge gaps are likely to persist without revised strategies for science education and public outreach. To address this challenge, the authors developed a unique outreach program to actively engage over 100 high-school students in the investigation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The program uses robotic automation and interactive web-based tools to bridge geographical distances, scale up the number of participants, and reduce overall cost.\nauthors: Orna Dahan, Bat-Shahar Dorfman, Serkan Sayin, Brittany Rosener, Tiffany Hua, Anat Yarden, Amir Mitchell\nlink to paper: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000348\nIcons made by catkuro from www.flaticon.com\n","date":1564358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564358400,"objectID":"0f13c65ab3f43d319d2674c89d8356b6","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/open-source-toolkit/post/harnessing_robotic_automation_and_webbased_technologies_to_modernize_scientific_outreach_plos_biology/","publishdate":"2019-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/open-source-toolkit/post/harnessing_robotic_automation_and_webbased_technologies_to_modernize_scientific_outreach_plos_biology/","section":"post","summary":"Publishing date: 2019-07-29\nPublished on: PLOS Biology\nsummary: Technological breakthroughs in the past two decades have ushered in a new era of biomedical research, turning it into an information-rich and technology-driven science.","tags":["Commentary","None","PLOS Biology"],"title":"Harnessing robotic automation and web-based technologies to modernize scientific outreach","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Publishing date: 2019-07-29\nPublished on: Nature Communications\nsummary: Recent advances in optical clearing and light-sheet microscopy have provided unprecedented access to structural and molecular information from intact tissues.

The authors applied established valuation methods for open source hardware to quantify cost savings and as a result the value of an open source magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) currently under development by the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI2).

The BioCompute framework enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability.\nauthors: Gil Alterovitz, Dennis Dean, Carole Goble, Michael R.

This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas. Methods: Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas. Results: Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding. Conclusion: The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.\nauthors: Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun\nlink to paper: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194333\nIcons made by catkuro from www.flaticon.com\n","date":1521590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521590400,"objectID":"3098110840eab9d0171a23e103746429","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/open-source-toolkit/post/clinical_value_of_patientspecific_threedimensional_printing_of_congenital_heart_disease_quantitative_and_qualitative_assessments_plos_one/","publishdate":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/open-source-toolkit/post/clinical_value_of_patientspecific_threedimensional_printing_of_congenital_heart_disease_quantitative_and_qualitative_assessments_plos_one/","section":"post","summary":"Publishing date: 2018-03-21\nPublished on: PLOS ONE\nsummary: Objective: Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD).

To overcome these shortcomings, Anton Sheinin and colleagues developed StimDuino, an inexpensive Arduino-controlled stimulus isolator allowing highly accurate, reproducible automated setting of the stimulation current.\nauthors: Anton Sheinin, Ayal Lavi, Izhak Michaelevski\nlink to paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.01.016\nIcons made by catkuro from www.flaticon.com\n","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"e854c7a077232a13790312a4f4ba6697","permalink":"https://amchagas.github.io/open-source-toolkit/post/stimduino_an_arduinobased_electrophysiological_stimulus_isolator_journal_of_neuroscience_methods/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/open-source-toolkit/post/stimduino_an_arduinobased_electrophysiological_stimulus_isolator_journal_of_neuroscience_methods/","section":"post","summary":"Publishing date: 2018-03-01\nPublished on: Journal of Neuroscience Methods\nsummary: Electrical stimulus isolator is a widely used device in electrophysiology.
