Costing around 700 dollars, this system is quite affordable when compared to current commercial solutions and has the advantage of being standalone, which means it can work without a computer and it can potentially be powered by batteries, opening it up its use for a diverse range of fields. The system employs a black and white sensor, which makes it a good candidate for applications that require fluorescence detection. With good explanations on the rationale behind design decisions and a supporting repository, this paper is a good example on the amazing possibilities of Open Source Hardware for research.

Discovery and comparison of structures such as modular communities, rich clubs, hubs, and trees yield insight into the generative mechanisms and functional properties of the graph. Often, two graphs are compared via a pairwise distance measure, with a small distance indicating structural similarity and vice versa. Common choices include spectral distances and distances based on node affinities. However, no comparative study of the efficacy of these distance measures in discerning between common graph topologies at different structural scales has been presented. In this work, Wills and Meyer compare commonly used graph metrics and distance measures, and demonstrate their ability to discern between common topological features found in both random graph models and real world networks.\u0026rsquo;\nauthors: \u0026lsquo;Peter Wills, François G.

For biomedical image data, classical image-segmentation methods like thresholding or edge detection are typically used. While those methods perform well for labelled objects, they are reaching a limit when samples are poorly contrasted with the background, or when only parts of larger structures should be detected. Furthermore, the development of such pipelines requires substantial engineering of analysis workflows and often results in case-specific solutions.

A challenge in biodesign remains how to use these and other repository-based sequences effectively, correctly, and seamlessly. This work describes an approach to plasmid design where a plasmid is specified as simply a DNA sequence or list of features. The proposed software then finds the most cost-effective combination of synthetic and PCR-prepared repository fragments to build the plasmid via Gibson assembly. '\nauthors: \u0026lsquo;Joshua J.
